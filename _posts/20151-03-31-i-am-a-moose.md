If you give a moose a beer... basically, just don't give a moose a beer.

If you give a moose a beer, he'll want a taco.

I was born eight summers ago, way up north. It was cold. And I didn't have much fat, so I moved further south. I much prefer the climate of Texas, and I like to drink hot coffee in the summer-time, so naturally, snow wasn't for me.
