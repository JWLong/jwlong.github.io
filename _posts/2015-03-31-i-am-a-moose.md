If you give a moose a beer... basically, just don't give a moose a beer.

If you give a moose a beer, he'll want a taco.

I really like tacos. Austin is a good place for moose who like tacos, but to be fair, that is a fairly niche interest amongst my species. Most have never really had a fair chance at a good taco, though. Canadians aren't exactly known for their taco-making abilities.

So, funny story: you may have noticed that you've never really noticed a moose in Austin before.

I was born way up north. It was cold. And I didn't have much fat, so I moved further south. I much prefer the climate of Texas, and I like to drink hot coffee in the summer-time, so naturally, snow wasn't for me.

On occasion, I think a thought that seems pretty clever. Sometimes I'll tweet that thought using [@CaffeineMoose](https://twitter.com/CaffeineMoose), but tweeting is hard when you don't have opposable thumbs, so usually I just wait until I have several clever thoughts, and pretend like they were meant to be an essay.

There are dozen's of prominent moose essayists, though, so if you're here, you're probably more interested in the novelty of the Moose Rubyist. You can take a look at my [github account](https://github.com/caffeinatedmoose), to make sure that I'm not just like that monkey that learned enough ASL to indicate that it was hungry.
